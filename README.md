Insertion Sort
  - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time by using comparisons
  - iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position
    - Start w/ the 2nd element of array b/c first element is assumed to be sorted
    - compare 2nd element w/ the first element and check if the second element is smaller
      -if so swap them
    - move to third element and compare it w/ first two and place it correctly
    - repeat until array is sorted
 - Pros
   - efficent for small data sets
   - simple and easy to use/implement 
 - Cons
   -  It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort and merge sort
 - Big O Notation
   - O(nÂ²)
